# CryptoClustering


## Decription

For this assignment, we are using unsupervised machine learning models in order to cluster various Cryptocurrencies according to their performance over different timeframes.  We have used both KMeans and Principal Component Analysis in order to perform this analysis.  <br><br.

Both models returned fairly similar results across 4 different clusters.  When visualzing the two models on a scatterplot, the PCA mdoel has more clearly defined clusters.
